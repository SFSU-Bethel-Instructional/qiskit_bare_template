# qiskit_bare_template

This repos contains a bare-bones Jupyter notebook that imports several portions of the qiskit distribution.

The bits imported are (likely) sufficient to begin building simple quantum circuits, visualizing the circuit,
running the circuit on local Aer simulators, and visualizing the quantum state of the circuit.

For more information about the Aer simulator family, see
[this link](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/tutorials/1_aer_provider.html).
